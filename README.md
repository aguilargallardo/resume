## Work Experience

Lambda School    January 2020 – May 2020

Data Science Team Lead – Los Angeles, CA

* Managed a group of data science students within the Lambda School data science program.  

* Debugging students code with python, python libraries and developer technologies (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, PCA, Scikit-Learn, Flask, SQL, Git, Bash).  

* Grading all assignments and administering assessments of the students.   

* Hosting daily stand up meetings to keep track of the students, take accountability, and debugging code. 

* Product managing students’ projects during build weeks. 

 

### Ignitus     April 2020 - Present

NLP Intern – Los Angeles, CA

* Worked with the NLP team at Ignitus to help build their NLP modules for their learning management system that they are building. 

* Researched different NLP technologies (spaCy, NLTK, Word2Vec, TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer) that can contribute to their data science curriculum. 



## Projects

### Subreddit Finder

This app allows you to write a reddit post that will be sent to a Naïve Bayes classifier and will return the best subreddit for you to post on. 

* Developed a backend REST API using the Flask framework with python while using basic HTML and CSS for the landing page. 

* Processed the data with the NLP library spaCy.  

* The models I used were k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier with a GridSearchCV and Naïve Bayes for the final model as it proved to be the most efficient to deploy on Heroku.

 

### BBC Topic Modeling

Utilizing 2,225 BBC articles divided into five different sections, I used python and NLP to process the articles into two different machine learning algorithms to identify the major topics of each of the five sections. 

* Utilized WordCloud and matplotlib for data exploration/visualization of the most common words in the articles for each section.  

Used both Gensim LDA and Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling.
